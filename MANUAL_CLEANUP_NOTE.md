# Manual Cleanup Instructions

## Remaining Outdated Directories to Delete

The following directories contain outdated React Native code and should be manually deleted:

### 1. frontend-temp/
This directory contains the old React Native codebase with deep node_modules structure. Due to Windows path length limitations, automated deletion failed.

**Manual deletion steps:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\amman\OneDrive\Desktop\dcapp2\`
3. Right-click on `frontend-temp` folder
4. Select "Delete" or press Delete key
5. If deletion fails due to path length, try:
   - Use Command Prompt as Administrator: `rmdir /s "frontend-temp"`
   - Or use a tool like "Long Path Tool" or "Unlocker"
   - Or move the folder to C:\ root first, then delete
